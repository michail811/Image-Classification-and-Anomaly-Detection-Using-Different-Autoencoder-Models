# Image-Classification-and-Anomaly-Detection-Using-Different-Autoencoder-Models

This project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to implement image classification using the VGG16 transfer learning model and autoencoders for anomaly detection.

  VGG16 Transfer Learning Model: For image classification.

  Simple MLP Autoencoder: Used for anomaly detection.

  CNN Autoencoder: Another approach for anomaly detection.

  Modified Autoencoder with VGG16 Encoder: Combining VGG16 with an autoencoder for anomaly detection.

  Models:

- VGG16 Transfer Learning Model:
  The VGG16 model is employed for image classification. It is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned for the specific use case.

- Simple MLP Autoencoder:
  This model is a basic autoencoder with a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture.

- CNN Autoencoder:
  A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based autoencoder is implemented for anomaly detection.

- Modified Autoencoder with VGG16 Encoder:
  This model combines a modified autoencoder with the VGG16 encoder, creating a unique approach for anomaly detection.
